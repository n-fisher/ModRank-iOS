# ModRank-iOS
iOS App for ModRank Site

Tracking current progress for my 436 project.

Testing
--
1. Build and run app in xcode 
2. Click the `+` button to add mods. 
3. The mod detail screen is tolerant of bad requests, and displays successful lookups.
 - For ease of testing, try looking up my released mods! `1117784063`, `1118796340`, `1104718095`, `1132557840`, `1136819681`
 - `random` is also an acceptable search term.
4. Once you have a mod's details in the view pane, click save to add it to your persistent mod list!
5. List comes with standard edit functions (insert, edit, delete, rearrange)
